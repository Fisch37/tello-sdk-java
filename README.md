# Tello SDK for Java

## What is this library for?

The Tello EDU Drone (Which you can read more about [here](https://www.ryzerobotics.com/en/tello-edu)) is a small drone designed to teach children and teenagers about programming. Fortunately, it sports WiFi-capability and a complete SDK to enable programming in all kinds of languages.

This can, in theory, be pushed to its extreme with automated flight and object recognition.

## What can I use this library for?

Currently, this library supports everything but the video stream.
+ Do you want to do front flips? You can!
+ Do you want to fly complex arcs and curves? You can!
+ Do you want to use raw inputs to create a fully automated drone that regulates its height according to the strength of the WiFi-signal? If you really want to...

## What other dependencies do I need?

None! But a Java version might be helpful. Specifically, I recommend Java 16. Others might work although I cannot reliably confirm that. 

## Where can I download this library?

If you wish to download the source code, just download the whole repo. 
If you only want to use the library, download the JAR-file located in the `build` folder.

## I want to use this library in a project of my own. Can I do that?

Sure! Just don't copy my library and upload it elsewhere.

# Where in the world did you hide the documentation?

Oops... The documentation doesn't exist yet, but rest assured, it's coming soon(-ish)!
